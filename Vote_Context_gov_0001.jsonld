    "comment": "Reducing Cardano's Treasury Tax from 20% to 10% might seem appealing in the short-term by slightly boosting staking rewards, but this benefit is minimal compared to the significant long-term risks. Such a cut would sharply decrease funding available for critical ecosystem growth, innovation, and infrastructure. Instead of a tax reduction, it's wiser to allocate treasury resources towards strategic priorities such as marketing to attract wider adoption, supporting high-quality dApp development, scaling initiatives, and advancing Cardano’s core blockchain technology—including important improvements planned for 2025 and beyond. Prioritizing efforts like these ensures lasting value for stakeholders, strengthens Cardano’s position, and secures sustainable growth rather than risking ecosystem stagnation for temporary gains."
